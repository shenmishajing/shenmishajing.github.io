		\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
			\item Motivated by the performance degradation of both single and multi-agent systems over long-term interactions, this project addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks, which often rely on human-crafted tasks requiring only a few, fixed-sequence tool invocations.
			\item Proposed and developed a novel framework to programmatically generate benchmarks of arbitrary length and complexity by constructing rule-based, tool-use dependency trees, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of agent capabilities in extended interaction scenarios.
			\item The generated benchmarks cover a diverse set of tasks, including document retrieval, image reasoning, and code analysis, to ensure comprehensive assessment.
			\item Investigated the scaling laws that govern agent performance as a function of interaction count, analyzing how these laws shift under varying per-interaction task difficulties.
			% \item Led the conceptualization of the benchmark, implemented the generation framework, and conducted extensive experiments to establish new scaling principles for agentic systems.

		\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
			\item While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has successfully trained multi-turn agents in domains with verifiable rewards (e.g., mathematics, code generation), its application is severely limited in domains where such clear reward signals are unavailable. To bridge this gap, this project proposes a novel framework that learns a reward model from verifiable domains to guide agent training in unverifiable ones.
			\item First, an agent model is trained using RL to act as an expert judge on tasks with verifiable ground truth. This "agent-judge" learns to effectively assess the quality and correctness of complex outputs. Subsequently, this trained agent-judge is utilized to generate reward signals for new, unverifiable tasks, enabling the extension of powerful RL-based agent training to a broader range of applications.
			\item The framework incorporates an iterative refinement loop, where the agent-judge is continually updated alongside the distributions of verifiable and unverifiable tasks to progressively enhance system performance.
			% \item Proposed the core methodology, designed the two-stage training pipeline, and am leading the experimental validation on using a learned judge for reward signaling.

	% 	\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
	% 		\item Motivated by the challenge of deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices, this project seeks to enable seamless collaboration between cloud-hosted LLMs and smaller models deployed on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches).
	% 		\item Compared to previous methods that require frequent communication by uploading hidden states, or speculative decoding approaches that suffer from high interaction frequency and latency, this method significantly reduces communication overhead and latency.
	% 		% \item Designed and led the implementation of a novel framework where edge devices perform initial inference locally, and a lightweight communication protocol selectively queries the cloud-hosted LLM for complex tokens, optimizing the inference process.
	% 		\item Achieved reduced latency and communication costs while maintaining competitive performance, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.
	% 		\item Led the entire project, proposed the method, developed the system, and conducted extensive experiments and benchmarking.

	% 	\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
	% 		\item While complex queries often necessitate large language models (LLMs), many tokens within these queries are simple enough to be handled by smaller models. Conversely, even in responses to simple queries, certain critical tokens may exceed the capabilities of the smaller model.
	% 		\item Unlike previous query-level routing methods, which inefficiently route entire queries to either a large or small model, this project develops a token-level router to optimize model collaboration.
	% 		\item Design a framework where a small model generates tokens and an additional token-level router is employed to score each token to decide whether the LLM should regenerate it.
	% 		\item Achieve comparable performance while routing only ~30\% of tokens to the LLM. Achieve significant speedups at equivalent performance and performance gains at similar computational costs compared to baselines.
	% 		\item Lead the design and implementation of the token-level router, conduct experiments, and benchmark the approach against Sota baselines.
