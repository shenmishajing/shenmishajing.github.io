My name is Wenhao Zheng (ÈÉëÊñáÊµ©). I am currently a PhD student at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill majoring in Computer Science, supervised by Prof. [Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/). Before that, I graduated as a master's student in the Computer Science department at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. [Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) in 2024 and graduated with a B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University in 2021.

My current research interest primarily includes two frontiers of Large Language Models (LLMs): **LLM Agent** and **LLM Inference Acceleration**.

Regarding **LLM Agent**, I focus on exploring and enhancing the capabilities and endurance of agents in long-horizon tasks. My research includes:
* **Constructing Benchmarks**: To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, which often rely on human-crafted tasks requiring only a few, fixed-sequence tool invocations, we have proposed and developed a novel framework to programmatically generate benchmarks of arbitrary length and complexity. This enables a more rigorous evaluation of agent capabilities in extended interaction scenarios.
* **Designing and Evaluating Agent Frameworks**: I am also interested in designing agent frameworks that can learn from verifiable domains (e.g., mathematics, code generation) and apply that knowledge to unverifiable ones. This involves training an "agent-judge" to assess the quality of complex outputs and generate reward signals for new, unverifiable tasks.
* **Enhancing Foundation Models for Agentic Tasks**: Explore how to leverage the data and insights from these benchmarks to improve the reasoning and execution abilities of foundation models, enabling them to handle more complex agent tasks.

In the area of **LLM Inference Acceleration**, my research focuses on co-designing systems and algorithms to boost LLM inference efficiency, especially for multi-turn interactive scenarios like Agents. This includes:
* **Collaborative Inference between Large and Small Models**: I have designed collaborative inference systems, such as CITER, that use token-level routing to distribute the computational load between edge devices and cloud-based large models, significantly reducing inference cost and latency.
* **Efficient Attention Operators and Inference Systems**: I'm also working on building more efficient computational operators and inference systems to tackle the challenges posed by multi-turn interactions in Agent-based applications.

Additionally, my research interests also include **Multi-Modal Learning**, **Computer Vision (CV)**, and **AI for Healthcare (AI4H)**. You can find more about my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dR1J_4EAAAAJ) <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dR1J_4EAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> and [GitHub](https://github.com/shenmishajing).

Specifically, I have published several papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dR1J_4EAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> on the following topics:

- Tabular data prediction and text classification based on LLM[**<span style="color:#76AFE5">NLP</span>**].
- Weakly-supervised instance segmentation on medical images[**<span style="color:#73E87A">CV</span>**, **<span style="color:#E57694">AI4H</span>**].

- Image classification with ordinal regression and generation for healthcare[**<span style="color:#73E87A">CV</span>**, **<span style="color:#E57694">AI4H</span>**].

In addition, I am also interested in the following topics:

- High-performance AI systems, including AI chips, operators in AI framework and performance optimization in distributed training.
- Reinforcement learning, especially for the application in LLM and games, such as StarCraft II.
- Physics, physical simulation and physics-guided learning.
- Any interesting technical topics in computer science, physics and finance I am not familiar with now.

In my spare time, I also enjoy writing some helpful and interesting tools for research and daily life. You can find them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shenmishajing). -->
