<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Wenhao Zheng (ÈÉëÊñáÊµ©) and I am currently a master's student in the Computer Science department at Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274). Before that, I graduated with a B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University.

My current research interest primarily includes **<span style="color:#73E87A">Computer Vision (CV)</span>**, **<span style="color:#76AFE5">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>** based on LLMs and **<span style="color:#76E5D2">Multi-Modal Learning (MML)</span>** involving Vision and Language modalities, especially for **<span style="color:#E57694">Healthcare (AI4H)</span>**. Specifically, I have published several papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dR1J_4EAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> on the following topics:

- Tabular data prediction and text classification based on LLM[**<span style="color:#76AFE5">NLP</span>**].
- Weakly-supervised instance segmentation on medical images[**<span style="color:#73E87A">CV</span>**, **<span style="color:#E57694">AI4H</span>**].
- Object detection with multiple modalities for healthcare[**<span style="color:#73E87A">CV</span>**, **<span style="color:#76E5D2">MML</span>**, **<span style="color:#E57694">AI4H</span>**].
- Image classification with ordinal regression and generation for healthcare[**<span style="color:#73E87A">CV</span>**, **<span style="color:#E57694">AI4H</span>**].

In addition, I am also interested in the following topics:

- High-performance AI systems, including AI chips, operators in AI framework and performance optimization in distributed training.
- Reinforcement learning, especially for the application in LLM and games, such as StarCraft II.
- Physics, physical simulation and physics-guided learning.
- Any interesting technical topics in computer science, physics and finance I am not familiar with now.

In my spare time, I also enjoy writing some helpful and interesting tools for research and daily life. You can find them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shenmishajing).

It is the first work to propose a bespoke approach, called PAL, for instance segmentation of convex objects, leveraging the convex shapes of biomedical targets to generate the profile (i.e., masks) with bounding boxes. PAL outperforms other box-supervised models (e.g., BoxInst), and achieves comparable performance with mask-supervised models including Mask R-CNN and Cascade Mask R-CNN, on convex object instance segmentation tasks. In addition, we show that PAL demonstrates promising performance even for non-convex objects in practical applications.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
We propose a novel task-decomposing and cell-comparing framework for cervical lesion cell detection. The original detection task is decomposed into two detection subtasks first and a decompose-and-integrate head is introduced to model those tasks encouraging the network to focus on specific cell structures. In addition, cell comparison is performed by introducing a dynamic comparing module and an instance contrastive loss for both normal-abnormal and abnormal-abnormal cells comparison, enhancing the ability of the model to distinguish different kinds of lesion cells.
